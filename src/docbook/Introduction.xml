    This talk will introduce automated specification-based testing, original inspired by QuickCheck for Haskell by
    Koen Claessen and John Hughes. Since QuickCheck has been introduced in a previous meeting
    <ulink url="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group/calendar/10469028/">§</ulink>, we will be discussing
    a clone for the Scala programming language, called ScalaCheck.
